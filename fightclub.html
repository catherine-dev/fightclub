<h3> <b>What is a Fight Club?</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li><em>Fight Club</em> is a story about rebellion against the status quo and a plea for the simple life. It
        criticizes the
        ways in which we are so hung up on security, and material possessions, and how people let social norms dictate
        their lives.</li>
    <li>The Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also
        mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the <em>Narrator's</em> physical condition
        worsens
        while <em>Tyler Durden's</em> appearance improves.</li>
    <li>Fight Club examines <em>Generation X</em> angst as '"the middle children of history". Norton said it examines
        the
        value
        conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had "its value system
        largely dictated to it by advertising culture", and was told one could achieve "spiritual happiness through home
        furnishing".</li>
</ul>
<h3>The beauty of the cinematography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people "sort of shiny". The appearance of the
        Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as
        "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into".
    </li>
    <li> The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore
        opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a "smack-fiend patina". Fincher and
        Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime
        exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What song should be in the movie?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WizNXQGBMEk">Genesis by Grimes;</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9bw_VtMUGA">New Person, Same Old Mistakes;</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWUYRpVi7Yo">Go! Single Edit by Tones On Tail;</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1l6kxQNq54">The Perfect Girl by Mareux;</a> (it's the perfect song
        that should be playing while the narrator finds out that he is the <i>Tyler</i>)</li>
